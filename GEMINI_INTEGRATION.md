# Gemini AI Integration Guide

## Overview

The Research-to-Startup AI Agent Swarm now uses **Google Gemini Pro exclusively** for all AI-powered analysis and content generation.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Updated Dependencies

- Removed LangChain and OpenAI dependencies
- Added `google-generativeai==0.3.2` for Gemini integration
- Streamlined requirements.txt

### 2. New Gemini Client (`utils/gemini_client.py`)

- Centralized Gemini API integration
- Handles all AI model interactions
- Includes fallback to demo mode when API key is not available
- Structured JSON response parsing

### 3. Updated All Agents

- **Research Agent**: Now uses Gemini for innovation extraction and TRL assessment
- **Market Agent**: Gemini-powered market analysis and trend identification
- **Feasibility Agent**: AI-driven feasibility assessment and roadmap generation
- **Business Plan Agent**: Gemini-generated pitch deck content
- **Stakeholder Agent**: Unchanged (uses existing matching algorithm)

### 4. Enhanced Features

- **Demo Mode**: Works without API key using mock responses
- **Production Mode**: Full Gemini API integration when key is provided
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallback to demo mode
- **Structured Outputs**: Consistent JSON responses across all agents

## Setup Instructions

### Option 1: Demo Mode (No API Key Required)

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py
```

### Option 2: Production Mode (With Gemini API Key)

```bash
# Set your Gemini API key
export GEMINI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"

# Install and run
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py
```

## API Key Setup

1. Visit [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)
2. Create a new API key
3. Set the environment variable: `export GEMINI_API_KEY="your-key"`
4. Or create a `.env` file with: `GEMINI_API_KEY=your-key`

## Agent Capabilities with Gemini

### Research Analysis Agent

- **Input**: Research paper text
- **Gemini Task**: Extract innovations, assess TRL, identify domains
- **Output**: Structured JSON with technical insights

### Market Intelligence Agent

- **Input**: Innovations and domains from Research Agent
- **Gemini Task**: Analyze market size, trends, competitors
- **Output**: TAM/SAM/SOM estimates and market insights

### Feasibility Assessment Agent

- **Input**: Research + Market data
- **Gemini Task**: Create roadmap, assess resources, identify risks
- **Output**: Development timeline and feasibility score

### Business Plan Generator Agent

- **Input**: All previous agent outputs
- **Gemini Task**: Generate comprehensive pitch deck content
- **Output**: 7-slide pitch deck with professional content

## Benefits of Gemini Integration

1. **Unified AI Platform**: Single LLM for all analysis tasks
2. **Cost Effective**: Google's competitive pricing
3. **High Quality**: Advanced reasoning and analysis capabilities
4. **Reliable**: Robust API with good uptime
5. **Scalable**: Easy to upgrade to Gemini Ultra when needed

## Future Enhancements

- **Gemini Ultra**: Upgrade to more advanced model
- **Gemini Pro Vision**: Enhanced PDF processing with image analysis
- **Multi-modal**: Support for charts, diagrams, and visual content
- **Real-time**: Live market data integration
- **Custom Models**: Fine-tuned models for specific domains

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **API Key Not Working**: Ensure key is valid and has proper permissions
2. **Rate Limiting**: Implement exponential backoff for production use
3. **Response Parsing**: JSON parsing errors fallback to mock data
4. **Network Issues**: Demo mode ensures app always works

### Debug Mode

Set `GEMINI_MODE=demo` to force demo mode even with API key.

## Performance Notes

- **Demo Mode**: Instant responses, no API calls
- **Production Mode**: 2-5 second response times per agent
- **Caching**: Consider implementing response caching for production
- **Batch Processing**: Multiple agents can run in parallel
